This project aims to predict whether a tumor is benign or malignant using machine learning models trained on the famous Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset. By applying various classification algorithms, the goal is to develop a reliable model that can assist in the early detection of breast cancer.
Models used were :
Logistic Regression
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Random Forest
Decision Tree

Precision, Recall, and F1 Score: These metrics were used to evaluate model performance.
